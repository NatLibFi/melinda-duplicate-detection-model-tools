Use `train-model` to train the network with training set `trainingSet.json`.

Use `validate-model` to test the trained network against the test set `testSet.json`.

Use `edit-set` to modify sets. Useful for removal of incorrectly labeld items in sets.

Use `validate-model cross-validate` to test the tuned network against cross validation set `crossValidationSet.json`.

Use `extract-false-positives` to pick false positives from `guesses.json` generated by `validate-model`.

Use `display-items` to display false positives generated by `extract-false-positives`.


The process for improving the model is as follows:

1. Find labeled data. Positive examples can be found from merge-application merge. Negative ones from duplicate database.

2. Partition the data to 3 sets using `create-sets`: training, test and crossvalidation.

3. Use training set to train the model.

4. Use test set to test the trained model and tune the training.
Possible activities include:
  Training parameters may be tuned
  Network may be tuned
  Remove incorrectly labeled stuff from sets
  Improve/add feature-extractors to get better/more features for the network
  It is also useful to run `validate-model` on `trainingSet.json` to generate `guesses.json` for finding incorrectly labeled data in the training set.

`extract-false-positives` and `display-items` are useful for getting ideas of incorrectly labeled stuff/better features.

5. When happy with the model, cross-validate it. This will be the benchmark on how it works with new data. There should not be false positives (given that the set does not contain incorrectly labeled items, remove such items using `extract-false-positives`, `display-items` and `edit-set`)

6. Deploy the model to deduplication systems validate service.
